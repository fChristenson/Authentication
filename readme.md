Security is a BIG subject and requires years of dedicated work
to get really good at and most programmers suck at it.
(your's truly included)

Luckily there are people who love sharing tips and best practices
with the world on these matters so visit `www.owasp.org` if you want
somewhere to start.

## Basic security notes

* Never store passwords in plain text.
* If you have access roles be sure to think it through! (advanced subject)
